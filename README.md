##Our mission: 
To provide an anonymous forum where users can share and discuss topics about their work experience in their company

##The problem: 
Workers need a space to:

Vent unethical workplace behavior without fear of repercussion or retaliation.

##Our solution: 
An app that protects the anonyminity of it's users and allows them to post in a safe and civil environment
