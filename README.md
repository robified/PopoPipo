# PopoPipo

## A better way to CONNECT

### Introduction
- The purpose of this web application is to provide an anonymous forum where users can share and discuss topics about their work experience in their company.

### The Problem
- Workers need a space to:
	- Talk about the pros and cons of working for a company
	- Discuss salaries with no stigma attached
	- Vent unethical workplace behavior without fear of repercussion or retaliation
